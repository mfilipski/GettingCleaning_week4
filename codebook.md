# Codebook 

1. The dataset contains the following variables: 
  * subject : the identifyer of the test/train subject (1 through 30) 
  * actName : factor (text) variable with the name of the activity
  * actCode : factor (numeric) variable with the code of the activity, 1 through 6:  
(1 WALKING 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 4 SITTING 5 STANDING 6 LAYING)
  * datSetName : factor (text) variable containing either "test" or "train" to identify which dataset the observation came from
  * datSetCode : factor (numeric) variable containing either 1 for "train" or 2 for "test" 
  * All other variables variables are named after the original measurements (see below), with with either "mean" of "std" suffixes to denote the mean of measurements 
  * All numeric data for these variables denotes the average of all such measurements taken for a given individual doing a given activity.

3. Variables description from the original codebook: 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
